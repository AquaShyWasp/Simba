  Script Process Manager for Simba

{
Notes:
  - Right now each client has to send its own id with every message.
    I didn't find a way to detect what client the message is from. I suppose
    this isn't all that weird considering it uses named pipes on Linux.

TODO:

    - Define a protocol which clients should follow.

TODO MAYBE:
    - Change SimpleIPC(Client|Server).Create calls to use our own classes.
      Perhaps extend TComponent?
