TODO:

    -   Think of a nice way to create and modify DTMs.
        Creating a DTM everytime we search for one is hardly overhead either.

    -   Change get_last_error to return a fresh pchar?

    -   Add Bitmap functions.

    -   Document C api

Functions:
    -   KeyDown, KeyUp, SendKeys, KeyPress (PressKey?) (DONE -ianhedoesit)

    -   The rest of the FindColor* functions. (DONE -ianhedoesit)

    -   FindBitmap, FindBitmaps, FindBitmapToleranceIn, FindBitmapsToleranceIn,
            FindBitmapDeformedToleranceIn

    -   FindDTM, FindDTMs, FindDTMRotatedSE, FindDTMsRotatingSE,
        FindDTMRotatedAlternating, FindDTMsRotatedAlternating

    -   All Bitmap/DTM creation functions.

    -   All Colour Conversion Functions
    - - Not sure if this is necessary. This goes along with TPA functions; is it best to
        remake them all in each language or to export all the functions to save ~5k lines
        of porting per language? -ianhedoesit

    -   Target Window Functions


Ultimately:
    -   I want to pass not indices to DTMs and Bitmaps to the finding functions,
    but actual bitmaps. I also want to export most functions per the classes
    that we use behind the scene in Pascalscript; so we can make a class of
    those functions in say, Python.
    Python Class -> Function -> C Function Call -> MML Function
